## Usage:
Usage:
1.Make sure your world name includes the "rushWorld" entry in config to make the plugin recognize it.
On this basis, match "rushWorld2v2" and "rushWorld4v4" to distinguish between two different patterns
Finally, make sure that your lobby name includes the items in "lobbyWorld"
(The criterion for determining a world name is to include rather than equal to)

2.Ensure relTeamColorName_ Xxx Eight teams correspond to your BedwarsRel team name
(displayed name not color name)
